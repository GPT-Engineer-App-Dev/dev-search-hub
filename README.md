# dev-search-hub

Implement a landing page for a marketplace called Particles that connects companies with software developers. The page should have the following sections:

Hero section
- Headline: "Hire Top Software Talent, Fast"
- Subheading: "Particles is the leading marketplace for companies to find and hire specialized software developers in web technologies like React, Node.js, .NET, Go, and JavaScript."
- Call-to-action button: "View Developer Listings"

Benefits section
- Benefit 1: Access to pre-vetted, top developers 
- Benefit 2: Wide range of web technology expertise
- Benefit 3: Faster hiring process

How it Works section
- Step 1: Search developer listings
- Step 2: Filter by technology and location 
- Step 3: Message developers directly
- Step 4: Hire and start your project

The design should be clean and modern with a tech-focused color scheme. Include relevant imagery related to software development and technology.
